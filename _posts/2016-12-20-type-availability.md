<p>The table below gives a quick overview of type combinations that exist in the main series Pokemon games. Inspired by two reddit users <a href="http://i.imgur.com/c1z5YTa.png">ROMaster</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/PnOqyam">glitterizer</a>. I merely extended it to other generations and gave additional filters for added interactivity.</p>

<p><strong>What does the options represent?</strong></p>
<p>The exclude option excludes Pokemon that are classified as whatever is selected. For example if 'Form' is selected then it will exclude Pokemon such as Kyurem - Black or Deoxys - Speed formes from the table.</p>

<p>The mode option prevents Pokemon with double typings to be counted for both type combinations. For example if 'Lax' is selected Togekiss would be counted as both Fairy/Flying and Flying/Fairy and will only be counted as Fairy/Flying if 'Strict' is selected.</p>
