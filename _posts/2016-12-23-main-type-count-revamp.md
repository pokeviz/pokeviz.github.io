<p>The revamped version of main type count, it makes sense to display the data in a sunburst-manner Pokemon type data is hierarchical, each main type can have a secondary type. This sunburst chart's inner circle displays the count of Pokemon's main type by generation. The outer circle breaks each main type's count into their secondary type counts. The darker the shade the more of that type exist. You can click on any part of the graph to zoom in. Clicking in the center of the chart will bring you back a level above.</p> 

<p><em>Note:</em> All forms are included in the main type counting. However, redundant forms such as Arceus and Silvally are only counted as 'Normal' type.</p>
